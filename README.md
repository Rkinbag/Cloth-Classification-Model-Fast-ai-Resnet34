# Cloth-Classification-Model-Fast-ai-Resnet34
This repository contains the code for a cloth classification model built using the ResNet34 architecture in the fast AI library. The model is trained to classify different types of clothing items based on input images.

Overview
The cloth classification model is implemented using Python and utilizes the fast AI library, which provides a high-level interface for deep learning tasks.
The ResNet34 architecture is chosen as the backbone for the model. ResNet34 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that has shown excellent performance in image classification tasks.
The training data consists of a large collection of labeled images of various clothing items. The dataset may include categories such as shirts, pants, dresses, and more.
To enhance the performance and generalization of the model, data augmentation techniques are employed during the training process. These techniques include random rotations, flips, zooms, and other transformations applied to the input images.
The model is trained using a suitable loss function, such as categorical cross-entropy, and optimized using an appropriate optimizer, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
The trained model can be used to predict the class labels of new, unseen clothing images.
